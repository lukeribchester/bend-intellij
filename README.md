<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin provides support for [Higher Order Company's](https://higherorderco.com/) Bend parallel programming language to 
the IntelliJ Platform.

_**Warning:** While effort is made to ensure a stable and reliable user experience, this plugin is under heavy
development._

## What is Bend?

Bend is a massively parallel, high-level programming language.

Unlike low-level alternatives like CUDA and Metal, Bend has the feeling and features of expressive languages like 
Python and Haskell, including fast object allocations, higher-order functions with full closure support, unrestricted 
recursion, even continuations. Yet, it runs on massively parallel hardware like GPUs, with near-linear speedup based on 
core count, and zero explicit parallel annotations: no thread spawning, no locks, mutexes, atomics. Bend is powered by 
the HVM2 runtime.
